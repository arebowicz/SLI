# Welcome to Simple List Implementation In C Programming Language

## Short description

Just practicing -- list of lists.
I tried to split the program into clear interfaces (see *.h files). I think that there is no need to explain anything.

## To compile

Run command: 
'''sh
gcc -Wall SLI.c listOfLists.c list.c listItem.c -o SLI
'''

## Program arguments

Run the program with three lists-initializing arguments: number of creating lists, single list size and max value. For example:
'''sh
./SLI 5 10 50
'''

**As always, suggestions and comments are welcome :)**
