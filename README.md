# Welcome to Simple List Implementation in C Programming Language

## Short description

Just practicing -- list of lists and list algorithms.

## To compile

Run command: 
```sh
gcc -Wall SLI.c listOfLists.c list.c listItem.c -o SLI
```

## Program List of Lists arguments

Run the program with three lists-initializing arguments: _number of creating lists_, _single list size_ and _max value_. For example:
```sh
./SLI 5 10 50
```

**As always, suggestions and comments are welcome :)**
